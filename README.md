##Data Visualization - Role of Females towards Economic Development

**1.1 Project Desription :** <br />
The project presents a comparative analysis of the role of females towards economy. Females

2000 and 2014 to understand the trend change and to figure out the countries which still need
to work in this direction. <br />
