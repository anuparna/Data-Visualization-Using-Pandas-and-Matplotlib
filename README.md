##Data Visualization - Role of Females towards Economic Development

**1.1 Project Desription :** 
The project presents a comparative analysis of the role of females towards economy. Females
in many countries do not play an active role in the economic development due to several
reasons. However, with every passing year, the trend is improving with the spread of
education and employment opportunities. This project compares data available for 2 years,
2000 and 2014 to understand the trend change and to figure out the countries which still need
to work in this direction.
